Superfund visualization using d3.js choropleth maps

TO DO:
* FIPS==county id? If not, find county id
* Make boundaries/areas of non-superfund site counties visible
* Change colors to red
* Right now, county is likely colored by last superfund site. Make it colored by worst HRS for its county
* Make another version that does # superfund sites per county

OPTIONAL:
* On hover, show more data?
